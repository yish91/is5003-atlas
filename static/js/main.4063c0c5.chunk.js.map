component=\"p\">\n                Network effects refers to the impact that the number of users of a platform has on the value created for each user.\n                Positive network effects refers to the ability of a large, well-managed platform community to produce significant value for each user of the platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Negative network effects refers to the possibility that the growth in numbers of a poorly-managed platform community can reduce the value produced for each user.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                As we’ll see, positive network effects are the main source of value creation and competitive advantage in a platform business.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In the twenty-first-century Internet era, comparable monopolies are being created by demand economies of scale (a term used by the two experts largely responsible for popularizing the concept of network effects, Hal Varian, the chief economist at Google, and business professor Carl Shapiro). By contrast with supply economies of scale, demand economies of scale take advantage of technological improvements on the demand side—the other half of the profit equation from the production side.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                They can give the largest company in a platform market a network effect advantage that is extremely difficult for competitors to overcome.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Demand economies of scale are the fundamental source of positive network effects, and thus the chief drivers of economic value in today’s world.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                David Sacks’s napkin sketch suggests a second dynamic at work in the growth of Uber, one we refer to as a two-sided network effect.5 In Metcalfe’s telephone example, phone users attract more phone users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                All of these businesses attract two-sided network effects with positive feedback.\n                The importance of these effects for stimulating network growth is so great that platform businesses will often spend money to attract participants to one side of the market.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Virality is about attracting people who are off the platform and enticing them to join it, while network effects are about increasing value among people on-platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                We described our findings in a paper that analyzed the mathematics of two-sided network effects. Today, such successful platform businesses as eBay, Uber, Airbnb, Upwork, PayPal, and Google exhibit this model extensively.11\n                The growth of a network can produce negative network effects that drive away participants, even leading to the death of a platform business.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                One negative network effect occurs when the growth in numbers that enables more matches between producers and consumers also leads to increasing difficulty, or impossibility, in finding the best match.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The more complete depiction of Uber’s growth spiral highlights the fact that a firm in a two-sided market must manage all four network effects.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                And network orchestrators develop networks in which people and companies create value together—in effect, platform businesses.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                On average, they enjoy a market multiplier (based on the relationship between a firm’s market valuation and its price-to-earnings ratio) of 8.2, as compared with 4.8 for technology creators, 2.6 for service providers, and 2.0 for asset builders. It’s only a slight simplification to say that that quantitative difference represents the value produced by network effects.\n            </Typography>\n        </Paper>\n\n    )\n}","import React

        <br/>\n                Other platforms do not facilitate direct connections between users but establish other mechanisms for value exchange.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Each item exchanged among platform users can be referred to as a value unit.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Thus, the design of every platform should start with the design of the core interaction that it enables between producers and consumers.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The core interaction is the single most important form of activity that takes place on a platform—the exchange of value that attracts most users to the platform in the first place.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                These various forms of interaction were built into the platform over time, each designed to meet a particular platform goal and to help users create a new form of value.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                So let’s consider the three key components of the core interaction and how they connect to create value on the platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                A filter is an algorithmic, software-based tool used by the platform to enable the exchange of appropriate value units between users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Out of millions of value units previously created by producers (such as hotel proprietors and users in search of a mate), the platform employs the filter to select specific units that match the search terms and delivers them to the consumer.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                When designing a platform, your first and most important job is to decide what your core interaction will be, and then to define the participants, the value units, and the filters to make such core interactions possible.\n                As we see in cases like LinkedIn and Facebook, platforms often expand over time to embrace many kinds of interactions, each involving different participants, value units, and filters.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                But successful platforms begin with a single core interaction that consistently generates high value for users.\n                If the units are relevant and interesting, the user will be drawn to the platform repeatedly, generating a further flow of value units and facilitating more interactions.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                This involves an algorithm built into the platform infrastructure that analyzes user activity, draws conclusions about the user’s interests, preferences, and needs, and recommends new value units and connections that the user is likely to find valuable.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                One aspect of facilitating interactions is making it as easy as possible for producers to create and exchange valuable goods and services via the platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In other cases, platforms must develop intrusive rules for curating value units and other producer-created content in order to encourage desirable interactions and discourage undesirable ones.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Designing a platform to facilitate value-creating interactions is not a simple matter.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The more data the platform has to work with—and the better designed the algorithms used to collect, organize, sort, parse, and interpret the data—the more accurate the filters, the more relevant and useful the information exchanged, and the more rewarding the ultimate match between producer and consumer.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                As we’ve seen, adding new features and interactions to a platform can be a powerful way to increase its usefulness and attract more users.\n            </Typography>\n        </Paper>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport

which the car-service platform Uber has leveraged network effects to claim a huge and growing share of the rides-for-hire market from such traditional businesses as taxis and limousine services—and in the process has built an enormous corporate valuation in a startlingly short period of time.\n                In chapter 11, we’ll return to the question of whether platform businesses like Uber are engaging in unfair competition, or whether traditional incumbent companies are simply angry about being outcompeted by digital interlopers.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Platforms are leveraging this new capability to create entirely new business models.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Simultaneously, organizational boundaries are being redefined as platform companies leverage external ecosystems to create value in new ways.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                This phenomenon alone would lead to significant disruption of traditional industries, as platform businesses displace pipeline businesses at the top of the Fortune 500 rankings.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In particular, every time a platform removes a hurdle that makes the participation of producers more difficult, value creation is reconfigured and new sources of supply are opened up.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The advent of the world of platforms is also disrupting traditional consumer behavior, inspiring millions of people to use products and services in ways that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The rise of the world of platforms, then, doesn’t simply mean the emergence of new business entities competing with traditional incumbent firms.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                We describe these three forms of platform-driven disruptions as de-linking assets from value, re-intermediation, and market aggregation.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Intermediation by platform businesses is transforming industries, creating new venues where market participants are connected with greater power and efficiency than ever before.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Platforms like Yelp, Angie’s List, and TripAdvisor have created an entirely new industry based on certifying the quality of product and service providers—in the process driving some traditional industry certifiers (such as travel guide and consumer magazine publishers) out of business.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Platforms are also creating new efficiencies by aggregating unorganized markets.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Platform businesses, then, are disrupting the traditional business landscape in a number of ways—not only by displacing some of the world’s biggest incumbent firms, but also by transforming familiar business processes like value creation and consumer behavior as well as altering the structure of major industries.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                But in reality, Nike is testing an approach that, if successful, will lead to a new form of growth—one pioneered by platform businesses like Apple.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                When multiple products and services connect and interact using data, pipelines can start behaving like platforms, producing new forms of value and encouraging users to engage in more interactions.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Nike is not the only company taking the first steps in transforming its traditional pipeline business into a platform business.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The leaders of incumbent companies who understand the new business model can begin building tomorrow’s platforms in a way that not only leverages their existing assets but strengthens and reinforces them.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Incumbent companies can fight back against platform-driven disruption by studying their own industries through a platform lens and beginning to build their own value.\n

PayPal into the consciousness of users through, for example, television commercials, print advertisements, or email blasts, they created incentives that gave the platform itself a pull appeal—including both the ultra-simplicity of PayPal’s service and the payments that rewarded those who delivered new sign-ups.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The chicken-or-egg problem and the difficulties of attracting a large user base may cause you to wonder: why shouldn’t incumbent companies with huge existing customer bases take over the world of platforms?\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Sometimes you have to start your platform from scratch, which means that finding a way to attract a base of users on both sides of your market is an unavoidable challenge. There are a number of specific, effective strategies that have been developed and demonstrated for overcoming the chicken-or-egg problem.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The platform managers arrange for the creation of value units that will attract one or more sets of users and demonstrate the potential benefits of participating in the platform. Those initial users create more value units, attract still other users, and set up a positive feedback loop that leads to continuing growth. The Huffington Post followed this strategy by hiring writers to create an initial array of high-quality blog posts for the site, thereby attracting readers.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                To start, the platform creates conditions such that value units can be created that are relevant to users even when the overall size of the network is small.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Create a business around products or services that benefit a single set of users; later, convert the business into a platform business by attracting a second set of users who want to engage in interactions with the first set.\n                As South by Southwest has grown, the number of companies trying to use it as a platform launch vehicle has reached a point where there’s virtually no way to be heard above the roar of the crowd. And there isn’t always a relevant opportunity for an explosion of real-time publicity interest that is capable of attracting thousands of potential users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Your goal is to design an ecosystem where senders want to transfer value units through an external network to a large number of recipients, ultimately leading many of those recipients to become users of your platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Thus, the perk for spreading the word about Dropbox is not a cash payment that would only serve to empty the company’s coffers, but rather an opportunity to use Dropbox’s service even more, thereby stimulating further growth and encouraging users to make ever greater use of the Dropbox platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Making it easy for users to create and disseminate spreadable value units helps you build a platform that has high growth as well as high engagement.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                To avoid this result, the managers of startup platforms need to be strategic about identifying the external

to make it easy, fast, and effective for them to complete their profiles.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                As this example illustrates, platform businesses that intend to use free pricing as part of their strategy need to ensure that the value they create and hope to ultimately monetize is fully controlled by the platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                But rather than putting the technology in the hands of customers in exchange for a fee, they invite users to join the platform—and then they seek to monetize the platform by charging for the value that the platform technology creates for those users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In some cases, the ability to monetize a platform may actually increase dramatically when the number of users declines—reflecting the power of negative network effects to impact the value of a platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Meetup tested charging fees to political organizations, which were a growing portion of the platform’s user base, but this, too, produced only modest revenue.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Platforms that facilitate such monetary transactions can monetize the value created by charging a transaction fee, which may be calculated as either a percentage of the transaction price or a fixed fee per transaction.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Charging a transaction fee is a powerful way of monetizing the value created by the platform without hampering the growth of network effects.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In some cases, it’s possible to monetize a platform by charging producers for access to a community of users who have joined the platform not in order to interact with producers but for other, unrelated reasons.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Charging third-party producers for community access is effective if and only if the newly added contents—such as the job listings on Dribbble—enhance the value of the platform to its users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Platforms that charge producers fees for better targeted messages, more attractive presentations, or interactions with particularly valuable users are using enhanced access as a monetization technique.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                To this day, Alibaba charges no transaction fees, having managed to monetize the platform through advertising—as if a company that facilitated transactions, like Amazon and eBay, were to generate its profits by selling ads like Google.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Or, in a variant that we heard from the executive in charge of platform strategy for Haier Group, a Chinese manufacturing company, “You never take first money.” In other words, only after a value unit has been created and exchanged with results that are satisfactory to both the producer and the consumer should the platform business itself seek to capture a share of that value.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                If platform managers hope to monetize by charging for access to their user base, the platform should be designed to control the avenues through which content reaches the users as well as the flow of data about users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Techniques for monetizing a platform include charging a transaction fee, charging users for enhanced access, charging third-party producers for access to a community, and charging a subscription fee for enhanced curation.\n

who want to contribute to its content illustrate the challenges inherent in managing an open platform model.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In this situation, control of the platform, including decisions about openness, rests completely with the manager/sponsor firm.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In some cases, both the platform manager and the platform sponsor can be either a single company or a group of companies—with further implications for issues of control and openness.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                For example, there are both many sponsors and many managers of the open source Linux operating system, which, like the Mac and iOS systems, serves as a platform connecting app developers and other producers to millions of consumers.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                One of the crucial decisions a platform manager must make—and often reconsider as the market evolves—is the extent to which the platform will be open to extension developers.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In order to facilitate this extension of its platform’s functionality, Airbnb must open its business to participation by these extension developers.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                This is one of the control points that a platform manager can use to manage open access to its system.\n                Some of the first products released under the Guardian’s new open platform model include a Content API, which provides access to over a million articles; a Politics API, which provides election results and candidate information; a Data Store, which provides access to data sets and visualizations, ranging from a table of country-by-country laws and practices regarding the death penalty to a colorful graph depicting all of the time-travel journeys of TV sci-fi hero Doctor Who; and an App Framework, which facilitates app development, aimed at making the system easy to experiment with and build applications for.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Second, if particular functionality is reinvented by a number of extension developers and gains widespread acceptance by platform users, the manager of the platform should acquire the functionality and make it available through an open API.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The third kind of openness that platform managers need to control is user participation—in particular, producer openness, which is the right to freely add content to the platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Of course, this stipulation—that the objective is the development of high-quality content—is the reason most platforms reject absolute openness as a strategy for managing user participation.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Google allowed the development of an open-source version of Android, which is freely available to any manufacturer, while Apple sponsored the proprietary iOS operating system and tightly controlled the hardware so that it is the sole device provider and therefore the sole manager of the system.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Stories like these illustrate the complicated competitive factors that impact openness decisions—as well as the never-ending balancing act that platform sponsors and managers need to practice to ensure that their platforms remain relevant, vibrant, and valuable to a growing base of users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Naturally, a proprietary platform, which is sponsored, managed, and completely controlled by a single company, can only become more open.\n            </Typography>\n        </Paper>\n\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { makeStyles } from

component=\"p\">\n                As we saw in chapter 2, the new technology-driven communities known as platform businesses are creating a vast amount of new wealth outside the firm, and these external benefits must be designed and managed fairly.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                This makes it difficult for platform managers to ensure that various participants create value for one another, and it makes it likely that conflicts will emerge that governance rules must resolve as fairly and efficiently as possible.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                For this reason, platforms have much to learn from cities and states, which have had thousands of years to evolve principles of good governance.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Good governance is important in both nation-states and platform businesses because absolutely free markets, in which people and organizations interact with no rules, restrictions, or safeguards, can’t always be relied upon to produce results that are fair and satisfactory to those involved.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Individuals who benefit from positive externalities aren’t likely to complain about them—but they are considered problems from a business design standpoint, since they reflect value that is not being fully captured by the platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                We’ve mentioned some of the serious legal problems faced by platforms earlier: individuals who listed properties on Airbnb had their homes used for brothels and raves; people offering personal services on Craigslist have been murdered.21 Case law does not generally hold platforms accountable for misdeeds of platform users, even though the owners of the platform may be reasonably well positioned to regulate and control the behavior of the users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                And, as community resources grow, governance should be structured in nested tiers, with certain simple issues controlled by small, local groups of users, and increasingly complex, global problems managed by larger, more formally organized groups.30 Norms that emerge in successful platform communities generally follow the patterns outlined by Ostrom.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In addition to promoting economic growth, well-designed market mechanisms can incentivize the creation and sharing of intellectual property and reduce the riskiness of interactions on the platform.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Rather than seeking to minimize their own risk, platforms should use market mechanisms such as risk pooling and insurance to reduce risk for their participants and thereby maximize overall value creation.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Yet results improve when smart rules of governance are applied to platform companies themselves as well as to platform partners and participants.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                But in the long run, designing fair participation into ecosystem governance prompts users to create more wealth than if the rules grant a platform owner the ability to make arbitrary decisions without accountability.\n                Many platform managers choose governance principles that favor themselves over their users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                When signs of change appear on the horizon—such as new behaviors by platform users, unanticipated conflicts among them, or encroachments by new competitors—information about the change should spread rapidly through the organization, encouraging creative conversations about how the governance system may need to evolve in response.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The basic tools for platform governance include laws, norms, architecture, and markets.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Each must be designed and implemented with care in order to encourage platform participants to engage in positive behaviors, incentivize good interactions, and discourage bad interactions.\n            </Typography>\n        </Paper>\n\n    )\n}","import React from

interaction; the development of effective tools to pull users, facilitate interactions, and match producers with consumers; the creation of effective systems of curation; and decisions about how open the platform should be to various kinds of participants.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Platform managers will need to devise metrics that focus on some of the key

         The daily interaction percentage can be measured, its trend over time can be observed, and improvements to the platform’s matching system can be developed, tested, and evaluated based on changes in this metric.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The specific formulas you use to define the metrics for a particular platform business need to be carefully devised to be appropriate for the kind of platform business involved—the nature of the platform, the types of users, the forms of value being created and exchanged, the variety of interactions performed, and so on.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Amazon Marketplace, for instance, uses this metric, tracking the gross value of interactions processed by the platform as a key indicator of its activity level.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The metrics that best measure the number and quality of interactions in your ecosystem will change over the life cycle of the platform, and it’s critical to identify points at which these transitions occur.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Although these are distinct platform types with disparate needs, they all face the challenges of facilitating a core interaction, measuring the drivers of value, and innovating to maintain the platform’s ability to produce significant value for users.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Since the value of a platform is derived primarily from network effects, platform metrics should

companies should concentrate on metrics that track the strength of characteristics that enable core interactions on the platform, including liquidity, matching, and trust.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                During the growth phase, platform companies should focus on metrics that are likely to impact growth and enhanced value creation, such as the relative size of various

As platforms such as Airbnb, Uber, Upwork, RelayRides, and many more play a growing role in the economy and in the social and political spheres, issues about the rights of participants as well as the impact of platform businesses on other sectors and on society as a whole are becoming increasingly salient.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Today, some of the regulatory battles about platform businesses reflect, in part, efforts by traditional industries to use government regulation as shields against the competitive models that platforms introduce.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                This is data-driven marketing in action, and the sale of the underlying personal information about consumers is a significant source of income for many platform businesses.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                The readiness with which consumers publicly expose information about themselves through platforms suggests that few citizens care passionately about the issue of data privacy—which makes it unlikely that either regulators or platform managers will rein in the use of personal data any time soon.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                In a world where data is widely described as “the new oil,” it’s clear that the issue of data ownership will need to be resolved through some combination of regulatory action, court rulings, and industry self-regulation. Each new scandal involving the release of sensitive information, such as the 2014 disclosure that Sony Pictures had leaked access to the viewing history of millions of users, is likely to increase the push to establish ownership rights over user data. Such ownership rights would give victims a legal course of action after data breaches occur; the theory is that, given high enough liability, firms will take data security more seriously and act to prevent future leaks. In some niche markets, agreements over data ownership are already being developed.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Perhaps equally significant, the reputation of online labor platforms has already taken a serious hit in the unofficial “court of public opinion”—as reflected, for example, in more than a million Google results, many from respectable mainstream media outlets, in response to the query “Internet sweatshop.” In the long run, public disapproval of business behavior can have a meaningful impact on the value of a company’s brand—which means that the court of public opinion operates, at times, as an unofficial regulatory body that business leaders are wise to heed.\n                <br/>\n                <br/>\n                Grossman imagines a city government responding to the arrival of Uber by passing an ordinance that states: “Anyone offering for-hire vehicle services may opt out of existing regulations as long as they implement mobile dispatch, e-hailing, and e-payments, 360-degree peer-review of drivers and passengers, and provide an open data API for public auditing of system performance with regards to equity, access, performance, and safety.”\n                These include access to platforms, compatibility, fair pricing, data privacy and security, national control of information assets, tax policy, and labor regulation.\n            </Typography>\n        </Paper>\n\n    )\n}","import React, {useState} from 'react';\nimport { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport Stepper from
